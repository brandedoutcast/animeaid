# Animeaid
Browser extension to keep track of watched episodes from your favourite Anime

**ONLY WORKS WITH KISSANIME (http://kissanime.ru/) FOR NOW**

![Extension Demo GIF](demo.gif "Extension Demo GIF")

No more noting down or bookmarking the last seen episode or keeping multiple tabs open just to check for new episodes in a series. It's all taken care of by animeaid

You just watch your anime as you always did & animeaid keeps track what to watch next for you

Animeaid identifies the latest episode available in the series & provides links for next & latest episodes

The series & episode info is synced with your google account used in chrome so it's available on every machine you use. No data is collected by the extension & the information required to track the episodes is stored within your google account so it's totally private to you

Helps keep track of episodes by displaying the information like

- Previously Watched Episode
- Next Episode To Watch
- Latest Released / Available Episode

Feedback is much appreciated. Thanks
