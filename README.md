**ONLY WORKS WITH KISSANIME (http://kissanime.ru/)**

![Extension Demo GIF](demo.gif "Extension Demo GIF")

No more noting down / bookmarking the last seen episode or visiting the anime series just to check if any new episodes are available since the last one. It's all taken care of by this extension

Fully automated means you just watch your anime as you always did & this extension keeps track what to watch next for you

The extension identifies the latest episode available in the Anime series & provides the links for next & latest episodes

The Anime series & episode info is synced with your google account used in chrome so it's available on every machine you use. No data is collected by the extension & the information required to track the episodes is stored within your google account so it's totally private to you

Helps keep track of episodes by displaying the information like

- Previously Watched Episode
- Next Episode To Watch
- Latest Released / Available Episode

Feedback is much appreciated. Thanks
